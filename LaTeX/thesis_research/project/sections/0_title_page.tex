\begin{abstract}
Smallholder coffee producers face a combination of pre- and post-harvest risk factors
that leaves them particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. A popular form of on-farm
diversification is honey production through beekeeping, that has both nutritional and
commercial value. This study investigates the role of honey production as means of food
security management due to the heightened pollinating activity during the coffee flowering
stage that follows the annual coffee harvest provides an additional non-contemporaneous
source of income. Using primary data collected in coffee-producing regions of Chiapas,
Mexico, I find that during the honey harvest months, which occurs during the early stage of
the lean season, beekeeping coffee producers are less exposed to food insecurity over coffee
producers who donâ€™t diversify into honey.
