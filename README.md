README: Skills Examples

Grant Xavier Storer

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page. Included in here are a few examples of previous work I've done, along with templates and samples I've created to demonstrate my skills and to help others to learn what I have. 

One notable feature I would like to emphasize is the "Research Project Template" folder: while I have STATA \& LaTeX specific folders, this folder is a template I designed for students/researchers to start their research projects. It houses not only the LaTeX formatting needed to start an Overleaf project, but also comes with a STATA do-file with macros built in to store all outputs in a folder that is readily accessible in LaTeX document. This format can also be seen in the LaTeX folder examples, and in the STATA folder.

If you have any followup questions regarding my work, you can contact me at: gxstorer@gmail.com.
