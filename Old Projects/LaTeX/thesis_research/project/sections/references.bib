Estimation of this specification is undertaken using structural, maximum likelihood methods. Our main results based on exponential discounting are robust to alternative specifications such as hyperbolic discounting.

Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives’ success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk-averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing-country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory.},

Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the 
insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the 
standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity 
constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just one month later increases demand by 21 percentage

	abstract = {Risk management in agricultural production is a first order problem as producers’ long-run sustainability often depends on their ability to reduce the adverse effects of profit fluctuations. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight several aspects of the academic literature for which there have been key innovations within the last 10 years, and the topics are likely to remain relevant going forward. We focus on a range of recent empirical findings to demonstrate the breadth of interesting, researchable topics contained in the literature. We also propose a simplistic theoretical model to serve as a road map to the literature. The theoretical model we propose aims to provide a unifying conceptual framework for the recent innovations in the literature where many studies focus on specific and singular parameters. Section 2 provides the simplistic theoretical model that explains the agricultural production decision under risk. Section 3 focuses on on-farm production with modeling nuances related to technology adoption and management of both biotic and abiotic stressors and Section 4 focuses on marketing decisions that can affect output price through forward contracting, hedging, and storage mechanisms. Section 5 shows how the model can be extended to include off-farm decision-making and provides conceptual frameworks for land rental as well as off-farm labor and investment decisions. Section 6 considers the role of both credit-availability and insurance contracts, while Section 7 discusses some potential avenues for generalizing the model to allow for more nuanced risk attitudes both within and beyond the expected utility framework.},

In this paper, we investigate the relevance of context and task involvement on these inconsistencies. Our analysis is based on a sample of 244 German agricultural sciences students, which were performing an iterative multiple price list ({iMPL}) and a simple self-assessment question on risk preferences. We find that using a real life and subject context specific (here, agricultural) framing of the {iMPL} is leading to fewer within- and between-method inconsistencies. This is due to the fact that contextual framing has an increasing effect on task involvement (proxied with the time spent in the {iMPL}). Additionally, we find that contextual framing triggers the role of subjects’ context involvement (proxied using an indicator for students’ involvement in the agricultural domain). More specifically, both higher task and context involvement are found to decrease within-method inconsistency in the {iMPL} task. While also between-method inconsistency is decreasing in subjects’ task involvement, we found no effect of context involvement. In conclusion, our results suggest that by framing a risk elicitation method according to the subjects’ specific context, involvement can be triggered and inconsistencies and misspecifications can be reduced.},

In this perspective, we argue that involving stakeholders in the design of economic experiments is critical to satisfy mandates for evidence-based policies and encourage policymakers' usage of experimental results. To identify advantages and disadvantages of involving stakeholders when designing experiments, we synthesize observations from six experiments in Europe and North America. In these experiments, the primary advantage was the ability to learn within realistic decision environments and thus make relevant policy recommendations. Disadvantages include complicated implementation and constraints on treatment design. We compile 12 recommendations for researchers.},

	abstract = {Agricultural and applied economists have begun routinely using behavioral and experimental economics tools to answer important questions about agri-environmental policies and programs. These tools offer valuable insights into decision-making that can advance our economic understanding of human behavior and inform evidence-based policies. However, conducting robust economic experiments on agri-environmental topics presents unique challenges that can make implementation of these studies difficult and limit the applicability of results. This chapter provides a practical guide for researchers regarding best practices for applying experimental and behavioral economics to agri-environmental research focused on producer decision-making. We begin with a brief overview of how insights from behavioral economics have contributed to related literatures over past decades and highlight how economic experiments have been used to answer important research questions in those domains. We describe the types of economic experiments used to answer policy-relevant questions and carefully consider the advantages and limitations of each method in various contexts. We also highlight important trade-offs between control, context, and representativeness to consider when determining the most appropriate type of experiment to conduct. The chapter emphasizes five contemporary issues related to conducting robust experimental economics studies: replicability, statistical power, publication bias, farmer and rural landowner recruitment, and detection of heterogeneous treatment effects. To assist researchers in addressing each issue, we outline best practices and we offer recommendations for researchers, editors, reviewers, and funders. We also discuss research ethics and community engagement. Finally, we present a framework for prioritizing future economics research that can inform agri-environmental programs and policies.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in developing countries are often encouraged to get organized into cooperatives mainly to overcome production and marketing constraints that usually hinder the improvement of their livelihoods. However, impact evaluations regarding the contribution of cooperatives are limited; evaluation results are mixed and are not conclusive. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants and economic impacts of cooperative membership using household survey data gathered from coffee farmers in the Jimma Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. A propensity score matching ({PSM}) and endogenous switching regression ({ESR}) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both {PSM} and {ESR} models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The {ESR} estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable.},

Whether Fair Trade can achieve its intended goals has been hotly debated in academic and policy circles. In particular, debates have been waged about whether Fair Trade makes "economic sense" and is sustainable in the long run. The aim of this article is to provide a critical overview of the economic theory behind Fair Trade, describing the potential benefits and potential pitfalls.

Over time, a general convergence of all social sciences began, and various fields of psychology, sociology, anthropology, and political science started to overlap with general and agricultural economics. Within economics, it was especially the rise of behavioral economics, that has steered the field toward the other social sciences. It departs from the assumption of perfectly rational expected utility maximizers and allows for greater diversity in decision-makers' objectives and constraints. Agricultural economics has been early to recognize the need to make economic choice models more realistic. This can be explained by the particularities of agricultural economics and agriculture. Agricultural economists are tasked with solving specific, practical problems, and thus behavioral deviations from model predictions have always been salient and relevant to policy recommendations. Then, farmers—and to some extent also consumers—make choices in particularly complex and uncertain environments and must use all strategic tools at their disposal to deal with their “bounded rationality”. These include the reliance on culture and other heuristics. Agricultural economics continues to synergize economic theory and practice with insights from other disciplines and real-world experiences and is an important driver towards further unification of all social sciences.},

One widely embraced approach is contract farming. But relatively little is known about the appropriate design of financial incentives in a small farm context. We use the example of the Vietnamese dairy sector to analyze the effectiveness of existing contracts between a processor and smallholder farmers in terms of incentivizing the production of high quality milk. A framed field experiment is conducted to evaluate the impact of two incentive instruments, a price penalty for low quality and a bonus for consistent high quality milk, on farmers’ investment in quality-improving inputs. Statistical analysis suggests that the penalty drives farmers into higher input use, resulting in better output quality. The bonus payment generates even higher quality milk. We also find that input choice levels depend on farmers’ socio-economic characteristics such as wealth, while individual risk preferences seem to be less important. Implications for the design of contracts with smallholders are discussed.},

In those countries, contract farming, whereby processors contract out the production of some agricultural commodity to growers, is often seen as a means of spurring the development of an agribusiness sector, and thus launch the structural transformation. As a result, economists and other social scientists have extensively researched contract farming over the last 30 years. We review the findings of the economics literature on contract farming and discuss its implications for development policy and research. In so doing, we highlight the methodological weaknesses that limit much of the literature on contract farming in answering questions of relevance for policy. Despite valiant research effort, many of the core features of contract farming imply substantial challenges for researchers aiming to study the question “Does contract farming improve welfare?” We conclude with a discussion of where we see the literature on contract farming evolving over the next few decades.},

I provide estimates of communication spillovers using existing data from public goods games in Rwanda, leveraging variation in planning the sequence of visiting 147 villages. The resulting order created opportunities for some villages to communicate with past participants. Using ex-post matching of villages with and without these opportunities I find that communication led to substantial increases in cooperation, suggesting that unanticipated spillovers can bias inference.

	abstract = {A core result of contract theory is that contracts can help transfer risk from one party to another, the latter insuring the former. We test this prediction and explore the mechanism behind it in the context of contract farming, the economic institution wherein a processor contracts the production of a commodity to a grower. Specifically, we look at whether participation in contract farming is associated with lower levels of income variability in a sample of 1,200 households in Madagascar. Relying on a framed field experiment aimed at eliciting respondent marginal utility of participation in contract farming for identification in a selection-on-observables design, we find that participation in contract farming is associated with a 0.20-standard deviation decrease in income variability. Using mediation analysis to look at the mechanism behind this finding, we find support for the hypothesis that fixed-price contracts—which transfer all price risk from the grower to the processor—explain the reduction in income variability associated with contract farming. Because the assumption that makes our selection-on-observables design possible also satisfies the conditional independence assumption, we estimate propensity score matching and doubly robust weighted regression estimators, the results of which show that our core results are robust and that participation in contract farming would likely be more beneficial for those households that do not participate than for those who do. Our findings thus support the notion that, in a context where formal insurance markets fail, contracts can serve as partial insurance mechanisms.},

We do so in labs with {US} college students as well as in the field with Peruvian farmers. First, as regards price risk at the extensive margin, we find no support for Sandmo's prediction. Second, consistent with Batra and Ullah's prediction, we find that output decreases in response to price risk at the intensive margin when imposing a linear relationship between output and price risk. When relaxing the assumption of linearity between output and price risk, however, we find a nonmonotonic relationship between output and price risk. Taken together, these results are broadly inconsistent with expected utility theory. Alternative models of behavior in the face of risk, such as prospect theory, may explain the behavior we observe.},

This paper presents unique data on farmer perceptions of coffee price risk in Uganda’s post-liberalised market. Perceived price risk is found to be substantial, as expected. Less expectedly, perceived price risk is found to vary quite substantially across households. An analysis of this variance suggests that differences in coffee prices received in past seasons and the salience of particular prices explain a signiﬁcant portion of this variation.

	abstract = {The paper investigates whether coffee producers can benefit by taking coffee production/marketing decisions on the basis of coffee futures forecasts. The methodology employed is to match futures and spot prices for the coffee futures contract traded at the international commodity exchanges. Regression analysis demonstrates that changes in spot prices are not explained by changes in lagged futures prices. On the contrary, it emerges that futures prices tend to adapt to the prevailing spot prices. The deviations of the spot prices from the lagged futures prices are over 30 per cent on average and they do not follow any systematic pattern. Therefore, the hypothesis that coffee futures market information could benefit coffee producers cannot be empirically supported. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This requires that small-scale producers be included in, and benefit from, the rapid growth and transformation under way in food systems. Small-scale producers interact with various actors when they link with markets, including product traders, logistics firms, processors and retailers. The literature has explored primarily how large firms interact with farmers through formal contracts and resource provision arrangements. Although important, contracts constitute a very small share of smallholder market interactions. There has been little exploration of whether non-contract interactions between small farmers and both small- and large-scale value chain actors have affected small farmers’ livelihoods. This scoping review covers 202 studies on that topic. We find that non-contract interactions, de facto mostly with small and medium enterprises, benefit small-scale producers via similar mechanisms that the literature has previously credited to large firms. Small and medium enterprises, not just large enterprises, address idiosyncratic market failures and asset shortfalls of small-scale producers by providing them, through informal arrangements, with complementary services such as input provision, credit, information and logistics. Providing these services directly supports Sustainable Development Goal 2 by improving farmer welfare through technology adoption and greater productivity.},

Coffee is widely traded in the international commodity derivative markets. This offers scope for coffee producers to manage their price risk by hedging on these markets. The hedging mechanism recommended is based on the use of coffee futures and options. The mechanism involves costs, so the beneﬁts of hedging need to be evaluated in order to assess its usefulness for producers. It emerges that the main beneﬁt lies in producers being able to allocate resources more efﬁciently in the production of coffee. An analysis of theoretical and ﬁeld evidence shows that this beneﬁt can potentially be quite high, especially for riskaverse producers.

However, impact evaluations regarding the contribution of cooperatives are limited; evaluation results are mixed and are not conclusive. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants and economic impacts of cooperative membership using household survey data gathered from coffee farmers in the Jimma Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. A propensity score matching ({PSM}) and endogenous switching regression ({ESR}) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both {PSM} and {ESR} models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The {ESR} estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable.},

We do, however, find that measures of ambiguity aversion, loss aversion and the willingness to take advantage of a risk pooling scheme all correlate with well-being. Participants who are ambiguity averse, loss averse, and who react conservatively in the risk pooling condition all have significantly lower scores on our well-being index.

In deterministic environments, choices maximize consumption utility, but gain-loss utility influences behavior when there is uncertainty. Applying the model to consumer behavior, we show that willingness to pay for a good is increasing in the expected probability of purchase and in the expected prices conditional on purchase.

A substantial debate has emerged regarding the future role of smallholder farms as a means to lift rural households out of poverty and contribute to food security as part of modern agricultural value chains. We build a conceptual model to compare household income and total food output under smallholder production versus a hypothetical setting wherein households cease engaging as farm owner-operators, but supply land and labor to consolidated commercial farms. Based on the empirical literature, we calibrate the model to quantify the advantages in acquiring working capital and output marketing that can plausibly accrue to large-scale farming operations and offset any labor efficiency decrement compared to smallholder farms. Results show that households can earn more from renting out land and labor into competitive factor markets for a wide range of plausible market conditions. The higher the price premium commanded by and less the loss in labor efficiency on large farms, and the tighter the credit constraints on smallholders, the greater is the income advantage from supplying inputs to large farms over operating small farms. An output advantage also accrues to large farms under similar conditions.},

We propose an integrated conceptual framework to compare the two alternative farming systems for producing a domestic staple commodity, focusing on key economic factors that differentiate them, including labor inefficiency of larger farms, credit constraints for smallholders, and differences in farm–retail price spreads. We derive equilibrium expressions for economic welfare for smallholder farmers and urban consumers under the two farming systems, and parameterize the model based on publicly available data and recent empirical literature. An extensive simulation analysis reveals several key results from transforming to a large-farm equilibrium: (a) rural household welfare almost always declines; (b) total production of the staple almost always increases; (c) the sum of urban and rural household welfare almost always increases, often by substantial amounts; and (d) rural employment does not decrease, even with modest increases in capital intensity on large farms. Policies to promote farm consolidation, while protecting rural households from welfare losses, for example through income transfers, can achieve Pareto improvements for nearly all of the comparative equilibria studied.},

Spatially distributed buying firms in the presence of costly transportation of farm products creates natural oligopsony procurement markets. Although several studies have contributed to our understanding of price and output determination and the distribution of welfare in these markets, all are limited in that they address buying firms' locations or their choices of spatial pricing strategy in isolation, holding the other factor fixed, even though both would be chosen jointly in reality to comprise a firm's product-procurement strategy. Here we overcome this limitation by using computational methods (including genetic algorithms) to study duopsony firms' joint choices of location and pricing policy. Our results differ considerably from those presented in prior literature. In general, we find that, when buyers have the flexibility to jointly choose their locations and pricing strategies, market outcomes are much more competitive and locations more efficient in terms of cost minimization than has been predicted by prior studies viewing location choice or pricing strategy in isolation.},

We study the asymptotic behavior of the estimator when the systematic part of the outcome model includes latent unit factors interacted with latent time factors, and we present conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality.

In terms of environmental and climate change effects, organic farming is less polluting than conventional farming when measured per unit of land but not when measured per unit of output. Organic farming, which currently accounts for only 1\% of global agricultural land, is lower yielding on average. Due to higher knowledge requirements, observed yield gaps might further increase if a larger number of farmers would switch to organic practices. Widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats and also entail output price increases, making food less affordable for poor consumers in developing countries. Organic farming is not the paradigm for sustainable agriculture and food security, but smart combinations of organic and conventional methods could contribute toward sustainable productivity increases in global agriculture.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we present econometric and statistical methods for analyzing randomized experiments. For basic experiments, we stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large population. We show how this perspective relates to regression analyses for randomized experiments. We discuss the analyses of stratiﬁed, paired, and clustered randomized experiments, and we stress the general efﬁciency gains from stratiﬁcation. We also discuss complications in randomized experiments such as noncompliance. In the presence of noncompliance, we contrast intention-to-treat analyses with instrumental variables analyses allowing for general treatment effect heterogeneity. We consider, in detail, estimation and inference for heterogenous treatment effects in settings with (possibly many) covariates. These methods allow researchers to explore heterogeneity by identifying subpopulations with different treatment effects while maintaining the ability to construct valid conﬁdence intervals. We also discuss optimal assignment to treatment based on covariates in such settings. Finally, we discuss estimation and inference in experiments in settings with interactions between units, both in general network settings and in settings where the population is partitioned into groups with all interactions contained within these groups.},

The literature has been mixed as to how the alternative framing of information in positive or negative terms affects judgments and decisions. We argue that this is because different studies have employed different operational definitions of framing and thus have tapped different underlying processes. We develop a typology to distinguish between three different kinds of valence framing effects. First we discuss the standard risky choice framing effect introduced by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) to illustrate how valence affects willingness to take a risk. Then we discuss attribute framing, which affects the evaluation of object or event characteristics, and goal framing, which affects the persuasiveness of a communication. We describe the distinctions, provide a number of examples of each type, and discuss likely theoretical mechanisms underlying each type of framing effect. Our typology helps explain and resolve apparent confusions in the literature, ties together studies with common underlying mechanisms, and serves as a guide to future research and theory development. We conclude that a broader perspective, focused on the cognitive and motivational consequences of valence-based encoding, opens the door to a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of framing effects.},

They are recruiting subjects in the field rather than in the classroom, using field goods rather than induced valuations, and using field context rather than abstract terminology in instructions. We argue that there is something methodologically fundamental behind this trend. Field experiments differ from laboratory experiments in many ways. Although it is tempting to view field experiments as simply less controlled variants of laboratory experiments, we argue that to do so would be to seriously mischaracterize them. What passes for "control" in laboratory experiments might in fact be precisely the opposite if it is artificial to the subject or context of the task. We propose six factors that can be used to determine the field context of an experiment: the nature of the subject pool, the nature of the information that the subjects bring to the task, the nature of the commodity, the nature of the task or trading rules applied, the nature of the stakes, and the environment that subjects operate in.},

A qualitative study from Chiapas (Mexico) ﬁnds that a main reason for not choosing the co-operatives is the production requirements that follow organic certiﬁcation. A survey on production costs conﬁrms that members of an organic co-operative have more work hours than nonmembers in the same area. A probit analysis indicates that both coffee plot size and number of working household members inﬂuence the producers’ decision on sales channel. However, the study also ﬁnds that aspects not related to the organic production requirements can affect the choice, such as the level of trust in co-operative leadership, and the co-operatives’ payment systems.},

	abstract = {Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision. Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies, cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.},

This article goes one step further by suggesting that the final demand for these products could not have increased because the declines in world commodity prices were not transmitted or were transmitted imperfectly to domestic consumer prices. In contrast, upward movements in world prices were clearly passed on to domestic prices. As a result, the spread between world and domestic prices almost doubled in all major commodity markets during 1975-94. This asymmetry, seldom discussed in the literature, does not seem to be caused, at least systematically, by changes in trade and tax policies or factors such as transport, processing, and marketing costs. This article argues, therefore, that a special effort should be made to better understand the transmission from world to domestic prices, especially the role of large international trading companies that may have the capability to influence such spreads through one or several stages of processing in most major commodity markets.},

Several thousand insurgents, given a voice in the communiques of Subcomandante Marcos, took control of the capital and other key towns and held the Mexican army and government at bay for weeks. Proclaiming themselves the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, they captured both land and headlines. Worldwide, people wanted to know the answer to one question: why had revolutionaries taken over a Mexican state? No other study of Chiapas answers that question as thoroughly as does this book. Benjamin delineates the basic continuity in the history of Chiapas from the 1890s to 1995. The uprising and government's armed occupation of the state are but the latest violent episodes in a region that is now and has always been a rich land worked by poor people. By studying the impoverishment of the laboring class in Chiapas, Benjamin addresses how the Chiapan elite survived the Revolution of 1910 and remain in control of the state's development and destiny},

evidence that farmers' patronage is positively associated with competitive grain pricing and negatively associated with the firm being active in the community.

Moreover, participation in contract farming makes participating households about 18\% more likely to see their hungry season end at any time. Further, we find that these effects are more pronounced for households with more children, and for households with more girls.

Our study investigates the impact of an integrated value chain project, which linked producer organizations to markets and provided various types of training to their members. Using primary survey data from Nepal, we apply propensity score matching to ensure common support and statistical balance between project (treatment) and non-project (control) households. We implement the selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier methodology to control for unobservable characteristics and estimate a simulation-based stochastic metafrontier to account for different technological levels between the two groups of households. Comparing results between the translog and Cobb-Douglas production frontiers, we find that the more flexible translog specification shows no signs of selectivity bias while this bias is present with the Cobb-Douglas, motivating the need to correct for selectivity. Our main results from the metafrontier analysis indicate that project impacts are reflected in substantial technological gaps and significant meta-technical efficiency differences in favor of treatment households. Thus, this study shows that strengthening linkages between producers and markets can have a large positive effect on productivity. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that more vulnerable producers, including those with fewer years of education and smaller farms, receive relatively higher returns from the project compared to their counterparts.},

Finally, the study tests whether the effects (intra-caste and inter-caste) vary by caste—{SC}/{ST} versus non-{SC}/{ST} farmers. The study uses a survey of 478 mustard farmers in Rajasthan, India. Econometric concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity are addressed by employing specifications with village fixed effects and a series of robustness tests. Simultaneity concerns are addressed by analyzing the social network effects in a dynamic adoption framework. Results show that the adoption choices regarding hybrid mustard seeds are more pronounced for the lower-caste farmers than for their counterparts. Findings reveal that social network effects are significant in intra-caste but not in the case of inter-caste. Finally, the result shows that the likelihood of accepting advice in technology adoption is higher when {SC}/{ST} farmers interact with non-{SC}/{ST} network members than when non-{SC}/{ST} farmers interact with {SC}/{ST} network members.},

Eswaran and Kotwal (1986) famously derive this inverse farm-size/productivity relationship from the structure of agrarian production. The focal prediction of their model is that, in otherwise equivalent economies, a more egalitarian land distribution raises both output and producer welfare. The traditional (spot) procurement system implicit in the Eswaran and Kotwal model, however, diverges fundamentally from modern (contractual) procurement practices. We therefore develop a new model of agrarian production in order to determine whether the introduction of a modern value chain alters the welfare effects of land redistribution. The inverse farm-size/productivity relationship persists in our model, but we find that more egalitarian land distribution leads to nonmonotonic changes in producer welfare. We also find that the introduction of a modern sector can harm the laboring classes.},

In the face of this crisis, specialty markets have attracted the attention of the international donor community. These market segments have shown consistent growth over the last decade and exhibit price premiums in international markets. Therefore, if higher prices are passed on to farmers, access to specialty markets could help to alleviate the crisis brought on by low prices in the conventional sector. The present study attempts to identify the factors that determine farmers' participation in specialized markets and whether participation in these markets leads to higher prices for farmers. A two-stage model is used to analyze farmers' marketing decisions and their effect on the prices received. This procedure allows us to control for the endogeneity bias introduced by the marketing choice. Our results indicate that farmers participating in the specialty coffee segment do in fact receive higher prices than those participating in conventional channels. Additionally, we find that participation in cooperatives has a positive impact on the probability that a farmer chooses to grow specialty coffee and analogously on the prices that they receive. Based on these results, it seems that efforts to increase participation in the specialty coffee segment and in cooperatives would help to lessen some of the hardships brought on by low prices in the conventional coffee sector.},

	abstract = {For most poor countries of today, using agriculture for development is widely recognized as a promising strategy. Yet, in these countries, investment in agriculture has mostly been lagging relative to international norms and recommendations. Current wisdom on how to use agriculture for development is that it requires asset building for smallholder farmers, productivity growth in staple foods, an agricultural transformation (diversification of farming systems toward high value crops), and a rural transformation (value addition through rural non-farm activities linked to agriculture). This sequence has too often been hampered by extensive market and government failures. We outline a theory of change where the removal of market and government failures to use this Agriculture for Development strategy can be addressed through two contrasted and complementary approaches. One is from the “supply-side” where public and social agents (governments, international and bilateral development agencies, {NGOs}, donors) intervene to help farmers overcome the major constraints to adoption: liquidity, risk, information, and access to markets. The other is from the “demand-side” where private agents (entrepreneurs, producer organizations) create incentives for smallholder farmers to modernize through contracting and vertical coordination in value chains. We review the extensive literature that has explored ways of using Agriculture for Development through these two approaches. We conclude by noting that the supply-side approach has benefited from extensive research but met with limited success. The demand-side approach has promise, but received insufficient attention and is in need of additional rigorous research which we outline.},

	abstract = {Collective action through farmer groups can be an important strategy for smallholders to remain competitive in rapidly changing markets. Previous research has analysed determinants of farmer participation in groups, equating participation with group membership. However, within groups the commitment of members can vary, as marginal benefits and costs are not the same for all individuals, and opportunities to free-ride exist. Low participation in collective activities may reduce the ability of groups to provide useful services to its members. This article investigates determinants of member participation intensity, using the example of farmer groups in Kenya. The role of individual and group characteristics is analysed with survey data and regression models. Previous benefits that members received through the group positively influence their intensity of participation in group meetings and collective marketing, suggesting that reciprocity motives play a role. Low participation can mostly be attributed to structural and institutional conditions, such as group size and the timing of payments for collective product sales. More diversified farmers are less likely to sell collectively when group marketing activities only concentrate on one particular commodity. Since smallholders are often highly diversified, the focus of farmer groups should also be broadened. Further policy implications are discussed.},

The results showed that transaction cost-related factors such as geographical location of households, market information sources, and travel time to the nearest urban center influence market participation. Non-price-related factors such as security of land tenure, labor availability, off-farm income, gender of the household head, and years of farming experience had a significant influence on the transacted volumes. Output prices had a significant correlation with sales volume, indicating price incentives increased supply by sellers. Generally, the findings suggest that policies aimed at investments in rural road infrastructure, market information systems, collective marketing, and value addition of banana products may provide a potential avenue for mitigating transaction costs and enhancing market participation and production of marketed surplus by rural households.},

However, various forms of opportunistic behaviour have been reported, threatening the sustainability of inclusive supply chains. When formal institutions are weak, informal codes of conduct like trust can be important complements to facilitate market transactions. We explore the effect of opportunistic behaviour on farmers’ trust, using a field-framed trust experiment with prior signaling with small-scale farmers in Ecuador. These farmers are linked to different types of markets, including high-value export chains, and have been exposed to varying levels of opportunistic behaviour in the past. Our unique dataset allows us to control for self-selection of game participants. We find that a positive signal triggers a positive response increasing trust, while a negative signal has no effect – possibly reflecting very low overall trust levels. In settings where market linkages have failed previously, ex-ante credible positive signals could help to build trust and encourage small farmers’ participation in sustainable value chains.},

It is a growing phenomenon in Africa; it has been a component of some of the most successful income generating projects for smallholder farmers; it has been a component of various schemes involving parastatal processing firms and the terms of the contracts between smallholders and parastatals have major consequences for the financial viability of the parastatals and, hence, for the macro balance picture in African economies.This paper reviews the role of contract farming. First, we provide background information on its nature and scope. Second, we use the New Institutional Economics to discuss ways in which contracting overcomes market failures common in African agriculture. We outline the conditions that make contracting the preferred form of market organization, as well as conditions under which it should not be encouraged. Third, we discuss Kenyan experience in light of the theories presented in the previous section. Finally, we discuss the policy implications. The paper draws on secondary sources to discuss contracting in Africa generally, and on a recent survey of contracted farmers in Kenya, where the most attention is focused.},

Farmers are found to be highly risk-averse and to distort probabilities by overweighting a small probability of desirable outcomes. However, there is no evidence of loss aversion on average, unlike previous studies. Moreover, investigating the heterogeneous effects shows that some farmers significantly differ from the representative agent by still being extremely loss-averse.

It contributes to the literature by considering new determinants of participation and outcomes of interest. First, social capital at the individual and village level is correlated with cooperative membership more than other demographic factors. Second, cooperative members report an increase in the share of coffee sold and income from coffee sales but not in per-kilo price or total income. These two results reflect particular features of the Chiapas reality and the desires of the indigenous people the cooperative serves. Thus, they reiterate the importance for economic development projects to consider the context of their interventions.},

Reduced-form proponents criticize the assumptions invoked in structural applications. Structural 
modeling advocates point to the limitations of reduced-form approaches in not being able to inform about program impacts prior to implementation or about the costs and benefits of program designs that deviate from the 
one that was implemented. In this paper, we argue that there is a new emerging view of a natural synergy between these two approaches, that they can be melded to exploit the advantages and ameliorate the disadvantages 
of each. We provide examples of how data from randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}), the exemplar of reduced form practitioners, can be used to enhance the credibility of structural estimation. We also illustrate how the 
structural approach complements experimental analyses by enabling evaluation of counterfactual policies/programs. Lastly, we survey many recent studies that combine these methodologies in various ways across different subfields within economics.},

We do so in labs with {US} college students as well as in the field with Peruvian farmers. First, as regards price risk at the extensive margin, we find no support for Sandmo's prediction. Second, consistent with Batra and Ullah's prediction, we find that output decreases in response to price risk at the intensive margin when imposing a linear relationship between output and price risk. When relaxing the assumption of linearity between output and price risk, however, we find a nonmonotonic relationship between output and price risk. Taken together, these results are broadly inconsistent with expected utility theory.

Difficulties with measuring relational contracts and dealing with the endogeneity of competition have frustrated attempts to answer this question. We make progress by studying relational contracts between upstream farmers and downstream mills in Rwanda’s coffee industry. First, we identify salient dimensions of their relational contracts and measure them through an original survey of mills and farmers. Second, we take advantage of an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills to construct an instrument that isolates geographically determined variation in competition. Conditional on the suitability for mills’ placement in the catchment area, we find that mills surrounded by more suitable areas (i) face more competition from other mills, (ii) use fewer relational contracts with farmers, and (iii) exhibit worse performance. An additional competing mill also (iv) reduces the aggregate quantity of coffee supplied to mills by farmers and (v) makes farmers worse off. Competition hampers relational contracts directly by increasing farmers’ temptation to default on the relational contract and indirectly by reducing mills’ profits.},

In coffee value chains, upgrading opportunities are presented by the growth in consumption of specialty coffees, which are associated with direct engagement with producer communities by roasting firms, along with an apparent increased commitment to social responsibility. Known in the industry as “relationship coffee”, such interventions align with a value chain approach to development and are promoted as offering upgrading opportunities for otherwise marginalized rural communities. In this article, we critique the dominant development discourse of relationship coffee in Indonesia via three case studies of livelihoods and local agrarian dynamics across three coffee-growing communities on the islands of Sulawesi, Bali and Java. We find that the relationship coffee model does present opportunities for producer upgrading. However, these benefits have been subsequently captured by key individuals within the producer community who are able to accumulate wealth and consolidate their social position. As it is currently implemented in Indonesia, the relationship coffee model has reproduced local patterns of inequality rather than contributing to poverty alleviation efforts. These insights suggest the urgent need to develop a critical political economy of upgrading in the global value chain and rural development literature.},

Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector.},

However, assessing the quality of processed agricultural products may be more difficult than unprocessed products. The resulting information asymmetry between producer and the buyer may lead to perverse outcomes for agrarian households. Using primary panel data collected from over 1500 coffee growing households in eastern Uganda and employing fixed effects approaches, we show that grower-level post-harvest processing has characteristics of a market for lemons and is associated with lower coffee income compared with unprocessed coffee production. Activities aiming at moving growers up the value chain should thus be integrated with relevant characteristics of the value chain, such as quality assurance. We add to the literature by presenting a clear description of the pathway from supply chains with asymmetric information over produce quality to diminished farmer welfare with a novel focus on post-harvest processing.},

Similarly, economists have studied behavior in the face of risk and uncertainty for at least a century, and risk and uncertainty are without a doubt a feature of economic life. It is thus puzzling that price risk—that is, unexpected departures from a mean price level, or price volatility—has received so little attention. In this review, we discuss the microeconomics of price risk. We begin by reviewing the theoretical literature, a great deal of which is concerned with the effects of unstable agricultural prices on the welfare of producers, consumers, and agricultural households. We then discuss the empirical literature on the effects of price risk on economic agents. We emphasize policy responses to agricultural price risk throughout, discussing price stabilization policies from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Perhaps most importantly, we provide several suggestions for future research in the area of price risk given increasing risk on world agricultural markets due to both policy uncertainty and climate change.},

            We study the effects of Fair Trade ({FT}) certification of coffee on producers and households in Costa Rica. Examining the production dynamics of all Costa Rican coffee mills from 1999 to 2014, we find that when global coffee prices are lower and the {FT} guaranteed minimum price is binding, {FT} certification is associated with a higher sales price, greater sales, and more revenues. We also find that certification reduces the probability of a mill closing down and exiting the industry. Looking at households, we find that certification is associated with higher incomes for farm owners. Part of this is due to a transfer of income from intermediaries whose incomes decrease due to {FT}. We find no effect of {FT} on unskilled workers, who are the more disadvantaged group within the coffee sector.},

For sustainable coffee management, it is important to obtain an assessment of the spatial distribution of coffee plantation. In fact, most of the coffee trees planted under the forest canopy as jungle coffee. However, remote sensing studies devoted to coffee in Indonesia have been limited due to spectral similarity with forest. Hence, the shaded coffee plantation has been difficult to be mapped. This condition takes aerial photography as an alternative solution to detect the distribution of shaded coffee plantation with high spatial resolution. This paper presents an assessment of the classification method of aerial photography for detecting shaded coffee plantation. The data used in this study is aerial photography captured in a shaded coffee field located in Gunung Puntang. Some classification methods namely Pixel-Based and Object-Based Image Analysis ({OBIA}) were used. Those method performances were evaluated by comparing the classification result as overall accuracy. The result shows that {OBIA} is the best method for detecting shaded coffee plantation. It produces an overall accuracy of 73.01\%.},

            We play a series of incentivised laboratory games with risk-exposed co-operativised Guatemalan coffee farmers to understand the demand for index-based rainfall insurance. We estimate an explicit utility curve for every player and hence predict expected utility demand under counterfactual scenarios. Using these estimates, we provide a precise money-metric decomposition of the extent to which the low observed demand for index insurance is driven by expected utility theory, or by behavioural issues arising from a prospect-style utility structure. Our results suggest that consumers value probabilistic insurance using a prospect-style utility function that is concave both in probabilities and in income.},

Each subject also is asked to guess which of the five gambles each of the other subjects chose, and is paid for correct guesses.

Wealthy farmers are less likely to sell to the market, possibly because the shadow value of their time is higher. But if they have a large quantity of coffee for sale, they are more likely to sell it to the market. They are also more likely to travel to a distant market.

We also offer some new, robust specification tests by nesting the logit or probit function in a more general functional form.

A model is developed in which more cumbersome decision making by cooperatives may be compensated for by improved decision making. Conditions are derived under which cooperatives become efficient organisational forms. It is also shown that circumstances exist in which investor-owned firms and cooperatives can coexist in equilibrium. Finally, circumstances are identified in which competition results in a prisoners dilemma which comprises investor-owned firms only. Favourable public policy treatment of cooperatives may prevent this equilibrium outcome from occurring.},

We consider a risk averse banana producer who faces an optimal allocation decision on how much to sell to a cooperative vis-à-vis private traders. To validate the model, a numerical exercise was undertaken using farm-gate transaction data. The overall result suggests that under different risk scenarios, an optimal earning is obtained if a farmer allocates 70 to 85 percent of his produce to a cooperative and the rest in the private market. Any allocation more than 85 percent or less than 70 percent is likely to result in a sub-optimal solution given the current market structure and price setting.},

Because these members bring a variety of economic and noneconomic demands to their co-operative, managers must know how different member characteristics and performance perceptions influence their decision to patronize a co-operative. This study applies three models of co-operative patronage to survey data from rural Alberta. A Poisson regression is used to determine the factors that explain the number of co-operatives used, while an index of co-operative patronage measures the relative intensity of co-operative versus proprietary firm usage. A third model contucts a Tobit analysis of the amount of business conducted with each of several different types of co-operatives. The results show that older farmers tend to partonize more co-operatives, and larger farms do a greater share of their business with co-operatives than do smaller fiarms. Farmers who believe co-operatives offer innovative products and services are more likely to patronize them, while a belief that co-operatives should play an active role in noneconomic matters is not important.},

While there is evidence that experience of shocks could alter risk preferences, most of this research relies on just one dimension of risk aversion. Using a series of incentivized lottery games, we estimated a broader set of risk preference coefficients that correspond to cumulative prospect theory, namely the probability weighting function, the curvature of the value function and loss aversion, along with a coefficient for ambiguity aversion. We attempted to understand how past harvest shocks and the sociodemographic characteristics of maize farmers in southern Mexico related to these preference parameters. Our results provide evidence that experience of more severe harvest losses is associated with greater risk aversion and stronger overweighting of small probabilities. Greater harvest shock severity was not related to loss or ambiguity aversion.},

	abstract = {Central American coffee farmers commonly refer to annual periods of food insecurity as ‘los meses flacos’ – the thin months – indicating a recurring season in which they are unable to meet household food needs. Although this is a common phenomenon, little empirical research has documented the seasonal food insecurity that many small-scale coffee farmers face. Household surveys and focus groups were conducted with 29 members of an organic coffee cooperative in western El Salvador to determine the causes of, and responses to, seasonal food insecurity. Ninety-seven percent of households faced food shortages during some period of the year. The two most common proximate causes of food shortages were lack of income-generating opportunities to buy food and running out of staple food crops. Families coped with seasonal food shortages by borrowing money and food, seeking work outside of the community, changing diet, and selling livestock. It is clear that small-scale coffee farmers seek to maintain a balance between coffee, which provides income, and food crops, which provide staple food. Livelihood and income diversification are important coping strategies that should be supported; however, we conclude that efforts to address food insecurity in coffee regions require deeper structural changes to support peasant farmers.},

Key social processes that determine maize diversity include historic and cultural emphases on maize as a primary crop; land-use practices encompassing heterogeneous agro-ecological conditions; farmers? seed-saving practices; farmer selection of useful traits; and farmer seed exchange and purchasing networks. We consider the impacts of recent agricultural and rural development policies on these processes. We focus on La Frailesca, a commercial and semi-subsistence maize-growing region in southern Mexico. Qualitative data were collected via focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation in four villages at intervals over a 2-year period. These techniques were complemented with semi-structured interviews with local and state policymakers. Observations suggest that policies promoting market liberalisation, agricultural modernisation, and rural education have contributed to significant changes in the social processes which have historically generated maize diversity. Increasing numbers of smallholder maize producers are diversifying into alternative livelihood options, including temporary or permanent migration, and cultural and economic emphases on maize production are changing. Changes in La Frailesca raise important questions about the fate of maize genetic diversity as the Mexican agricultural sector is further realigned with the global agricultural economy.},

However, and as argued in this paper, obtaining a food staple (maize-tortilla) of quality is also an important issue for rural households and contributes to motivating continued smallholder production. Based on case studies in the rural district of Atlacomulco, in the state of Mexico, as well as in two regions of the state of Chiapas, this paper analyzes the production and consumption strategies of rural households. We focus on goals of food security and quality and note differential trends among households of varying characteristics and local contexts.

We show that the instrumental variables ({IV}) estimand can be embedded within the Rubin Causal Model ({RCM}) and that under some simple and easily interpretable assumptions, the {IV} estimand is the average causal effect for a subgroup of units, the compliers. Without these assumptions, the {IV} estimand is simply the ratio of intention-to-treat causal estimands with no interpretation as an average causal effect. The advantages of embedding the {IV} approach in the {RCM} are that it clarifies the nature of critical assumptions needed for a causal interpretation, and moreover allows us to consider sensitivity of the results to deviations from key assumptions in a straightforward manner. We apply our analysis to estimate the effect of veteran status in the Vietnam era on mortality, using the lottery number that assigned priority for the draft as an instrument, and we use our results to investigate the sensitivity of the conclusions to critical assumptions.},

It is based on Pakistan Social and Living standard Measurement ({PSLM}) 2007-08 survey conducted by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan. After having descriptive analysis of the important determinants of food insecurity, we have used logit model to find the probability for being household secure or insecure. The model is initially fitted with 16 (for general) and 19 (for farmer households) variables, selected from factors identified by previous researchers that affect food insecurity. Twelve out of 19 variables for farmer households are found to be significant such as household size, household size square, household income, number of rooms, dependency ratio, electricity connection, irrigation facility, age and age square of household head. To our surprise female education variable is insignificant for general household model. The results obtained are further analyzed to compute partial effects on continuous variables and change in the probabilities on discrete variables for the significant factors in the logistic models. Household size, education of household head, annual income and agricultural income are some of the most important factors influencing the household’s food insecurity status.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when consumers are not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of such a theory to account for some of the stylized facts of saving behavior. When consumers are relatively impatient, and when labor income is independently and identically distributed over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to provide a motive for holding assets. If the income process is positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively and at a greater cost in terms of foregone consumption. In the limit, when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes. As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no saving, when income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the business cycle, when income changes are positively autocorrelated. However, in reality, microeconomic income processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of the stylized facts in the actual data. While it is clear that many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to account for important aspects of reality that are not explained by traditional life-cycle models.},

The empirical analysis relies on experimental and survey data measuring risk preferences, learning processes, and the adoption of genetically modified ({GM}) seeds among U.S. grain farmers. While controlling for risk aversion, we link individual learning rules with the cognitive abilities of each decision maker and their actual {GM} adoption decisions. We find evidence that very few individuals are Bayesian learners, and that the population of farmers is quite heterogeneous in terms of learning rules. This suggests that Bayesian learning (as commonly assumed in the analysis of agricultural technology adoption) is not an appropriate characterization. In addition, we do not find a strong relationship between observed learning styles and the timing of {GM} seed adoption. To the extent that learning is a key part of the process of technology adoption, this suggests the presence of much unobserved heterogeneity in learning among farmers.},

	abstract = {Background:  Kaffa, Sheka and Bench Maji zones of Southern Ethiopia are high honey production areas with dense forest coverage. However, due to the traditional production system, the productivity per hive is low. To exploit this production potential in these zones by increasing productivity per hive, different governmental and non-governmental organizations disseminate improved beehives technologies. Yet, the impact of these disseminated and adopted technologies on honey production has not been determined. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the impact of improved beehive adoption on honey production efficiency.
Methodology:  A multistage sampling technique was used to select 360 sampled households. This study applied a stochastic frontier model to assess the technical efficiency ({TE}) of honey producers and propensity score matching ({PSM}) with probit model to analyze adoption decision of improved beehive and its impact on honey production efficiency.
Results:  The finding of this study shows that the number hives, type of beehive used, and proximity to the available forest had a significant and positive effect on honey production. The mean {TE} was 77\% that shows the deviation of actual from optimal production amounts. Beekeeping experience, education, level, cooperative membership, participation in improved beehive technology demonstration and extension contact had significant effects on {TE}. The result of {PSM} indicates that the adoption of improved beehive technology has a positive and significant effect on production efficiency, as measured by {TE}. Farmers who adopted improved beehive technology were less technically inefficient than those who did not adopt.
Conclusion:  Overall, the estimated 19.5\% difference in {TE} among the two groups shows there is considerable room for the improvement of beekeeping by efficient utilization of inputs and also provides strong evidence for the diffusion of improved beehives in Kaffa Sheka and Bench Maji zones.},

Real economic actors, however, are multiple-goal and boundedly rational decision-makers. An exclusive reliance on rational-choice models therefore generates the risk that both the pace and the type of behavioural adaptations to changing institutional environments are misjudged. Against this background, this article addresses three questions. First, can we use business simulation games as a convincing but low-cost experimental tool for policy analysis? Second, how do intentionally varied nitrogen extensification schemes impact the behaviour of students who participate in an explorative business simulation study? Third, do nitrogen reduction policies that are framed as voluntary as opposed to prescriptive schemes have a different impact on behaviour even if they lead to the same profits respectively? In our business simulation game, the student-participants take the role of farmers who are confronted with different policy measures aimed at reducing nitrogen loads. The student-farmers react very differently to different measures even though all measures have an identical impact on profitability. This is an indication that the behavioural changes that can be achieved per Euro of the taxpayers’ money, and therefore the cost efficiency (and smartness) of regulatory measures, are contingent on their specific design.},

In both experiments, the treatments took the form of short agricultural extension information videos shown to individual farmers using tablet computers.

I examine this hypothesis by estimating a correlated random coefﬁcient model of yields and the corresponding distribution of returns to hybrid maize. This distribution indicates that the group of farmers with the highest estimated gross returns does not use hybrid, but their returns are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technology (due to poor infrastructure). Another group of farmers has lower returns and adopts, while the marginal farmers have zero returns and switch in and out of use over the sample period. Overall, adoption decisions appear to be rational and well explained by (observed and unobserved) variation in heterogeneous net beneﬁts to the technology.},

            The investment decisions of small-scale farmers in developing countries are conditioned by their financial environment. Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer’s own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer’s social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.},

	abstract = {Agricultural technologies typically spread as farmers learn about profitability through social networks. This process can be nuanced, however, when net returns for some farmers may not be positive. We investigate how social learning influences demand for a resource-conserving technology in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. We identify potential adopters through an experimental auction and randomly select a subset to adopt. We exploit this variation in adoption across networks to estimate network effects on demand for the technology one year later using a second auction. Technology benefits vary, and network effects are completely conditional on benefits. Having a benefiting adopter in one’s network increased demand by over 50 percent, whereas having a non-benefiting adopter had no effect. These effects are strong enough to bring average demand in line with expected benefits. For many farmers, however, demand remains below the market price, suggesting that network effects will lead to increased—but not rapid widespread—adoption.},

The relationship of these input adjustments to experience further indicates the presence of social learning. In addition, applying the same method to input choices for another crop, of known technology, correctly indicates an absence of social learning effects. ({JEL} D83, O13, O33, Q16)},

We argue that this heterogeneity makes the adoption process more challenging, limits the scope of many innovations, and contributes to the stagnation in technology use.

We find that a large share of the expected gains from the technology comes from crowding in of other investments.

	abstract = {In a competitive market, a profit-maximizing producer's total revenue is determined both by the quantity of output she chooses to produce and by the price at which she can sell that output. Of these two variables, only output is in part or wholly within the producer's control, price being entirely determined by market forces. Given that, it is puzzling that the literature studying the effects of providing insurance to producers in low- and middle-income countries has ignored price risk entirely, focusing instead on insuring output. We run an artefactual lab-in-the-field experiment in Peru to look at the effects of insurance against output price risk on production. We randomize the order of three games: (i) a baseline game in which price risk is introduced at random, (ii) the baseline game to which we add mandatory insurance against price risk sold at an actuarially fair premium, and (iii) the baseline game to which we add voluntary insurance against price risk sold at the actuarially fair premium, but for which we offer a random 0-, 50- or 100\% discount to exogenize take-up. Our results show that, on average, (i) price risk does not significantly change production relative to price certainty and (ii) neither does the provision of compulsory insurance against price risk, but the introduction of voluntary price risk (iii) causes the average producer on the market to produce more in situations of price risk than in situations of price certainty, and (iv) causes the average producer on the market to produce more in situations of price certainty than in cases where there is no insurance or where insurance is mandatory. When looking only at situations where there is price risk, (v) this is due almost entirely to the insurance rather than to selection into purchasing the insurance. Our findings further suggest that (vi) even in the absence of the discount, the insurance against price risk would have a large (i.e., 70\%) take-up rate.},

While the patterns of agricultural disease outbreaks are well documented, less is known about the extent to which climate change-driven diseases are affecting crop production, disrupting farmer livelihoods, and potentially altering farmer migration patterns. In this study, we investigated the impacts of an extended outbreak (2007–2016) of coffee leaf rust ({CLR}, Hemileia vastatrix) on the livelihoods and migration decisions of smallholder coffee farmers in ten communities in eastern Guatemala, comparing coffee farming households from communities that had a history of migration with those that did not. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess the impacts of {CLR} on coffee production and farmer livelihoods, documented the migration decisions of household members, and compared migration rates and destinations between migrant communities and previously non-migrant communities. We also assessed the effects of crop loss, household wealth, and information access on the use of migration as a coping strategy among affected households. We found that smallholder farmer households lost an average of 71\% ({SE} = 2\%) of their coffee production during their self-defined worst year of {CLR} impact. Household migration almost doubled in response to {CLR}, both in communities that had a history of migration and in historically non-migrant communities. Migration was more likely among households that experienced greater crop losses of due to {CLR}. In contrast, migration was lower among households that had greater access to information. Our study demonstrates the potential for climate-driven disease outbreaks to significantly impact farmers’ livelihoods and increase farmer migration from rural regions, and highlights the need for urgent action to support farmers to adapt to these changing conditions.},

Currently, on-site disease detection is the only effective method to fell coffee trees for prevention of the infection. However, accurate infection detection over wide areas is difficult when conducted by ground surveys. Here, we examine the application of a remote sensing method. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}) values of coffee farms were computed using satellite images and compared with the results of the ground truth. We found that the standard deviation of the {NDVI} value (σ{NDVI}) in damaged farms increases as the average {NDVI} value decreases. This fact implies that the disease progresses in-homogeneously inside a damaged area. In the present analysis, up to 94.1\% of the damaged farms were discriminated by combining the {NDVI} and σ{NDVI} thresholds when 75.0\% of the damaged farms had {NDVI} values under 0.732 and σ{NDVI} over 0.044.

The following multitemporal variables derived from the R package greenbrown were used for classification: mean, trend, and seasonality. The results showed that coffee, pasture, and native vegetation have different temporal behaviors, which corroborates the use of these data as input variables for mapping. The classifications using temporal variables, associated with spectral data, achieved high-global accuracy rates with 93\% hit. When using only temporal data, ratings also showed a hit percentage above 80\% accuracy. Data derived from Landsat {TM} time series are efficient for mapping coffee cropping areas, reducing confusion between targets and making the classification process more accurate, contributing to a correct characterization and mapping of objects derived from a {RapidEye} image, with a high spatial solution.},

Mapping coffee land cover is still a challenge because it is grown mainly on small areas in agroforestry systems ({AFS}), which are located in hard-to-access mountainous regions. The objective of this research was to map coffee {AFS} types in a mountainous region using the changing spectral response patterns over the dry season as well as supplementary data. We employed Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and {ALOS}-Palsar images, a digital elevation model, soil moisture layers, and 150 field plots. First, we defined three coffee {AFS} types based on their structural and spectral characteristics. Then, we performed a recursive feature elimination analysis to identify the most relevant predictor variables for each land use/cover class in the region. Next, we constructed a predictor variable dataset for each {AFS} type and one for the remaining land use/cover classes. Afterward, four maps were generated using a random forest ({RF}) classifier. Finally, we combined the four maps into a unique land-cover map through a maximum likelihood algorithm. Using a validation sample of 932 sites derived from Planet images (4.5 m pixel size), we estimated a 95\% map overall accuracy. Two {AFS} types were classified as having low error; the third, with the highest tree density, had the lowest accuracy. The results obtained show that the infrared and near-infrared bands from the Sentinel-2 scenes are particularly useful for coffee {AFS} discrimination. However, supplementary data are required to improve the performance of the classifier. Our findings also highlight the importance of the multi-temporal and multi-dataset approach for identifying complex production systems in areas of high topographic heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {This article investigates member deliveries in agricultural marketing cooperatives. Since cooperatives depend on members’ contributions to achieve efficiency in processing and marketing, side-selling by members poses a threat to the economic viability of cooperatives in the long run. We develop a model for the farmers’ marketing decision that relates farm size to the share of produce delivered to the cooperative. Based on survey data from cooperatively organised coffee farmers in Costa Rica, we find that the share delivered to cooperatives decreases with farm size, albeit at a decreasing rate. The empirical results thus confirm the theoretical model prediction of a u-shaped relationship between farm size and member deliveries.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to improve our understanding of side selling in farmer cooperatives. Cooperative member side selling, in which farmers divert produce from cooperatives to competitors, threatens coffee cooperatives. This is a problem in Burundi, where many households earn income from coffee and cooperatives serve a collective action function.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Using data from a survey of Burundian coffee farmers, we assess the determinants of two types of cooperative member side-selling behavior: selling to both cooperative and non-cooperative buyers and selling solely to non-cooperative buyers.
            
            
              Findings
              Farmers who sell to both cooperative and non-cooperative buyers are more likely to be male household heads, be more invested in coffee and have larger farms than non-side sellers, among other characteristics. Farmers who only sell to non-cooperative buyers are poorer and less invested in coffee than non-side sellers.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              Additional research is needed to better understand why side-selling behavior differs between groups and to better understand how household head gender influences side selling. In addition, this study lacks qualitative data supporting quantitative findings. Future research should include qualitative methods to better understand motivations for side-selling behavior.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The study provides important information on what influences cooperative member side selling and focuses on specific types of side-selling behavior that have been largely overlooked. The study focuses on the role of household head gender in side selling, which is important, given the centrality of women to African agriculture.},

              We analyze how Costa Rican coffee farmer's behavior in an experimental public good game depends on the institutional structure of the farmers buying point (cooperative
              vs.
              privately owned mills), and on the background of their game partners (partners selling to the same type of mill or not). We find that cooperative farmers do not display more public good orientation than private market farmers when playing with partners from the same type of mill. However, though farmers selling to private mills make no difference with respect to the background of partners, farmers selling to cooperatives significantly decrease contributions when paired with non-cooperative members. Finally, we study how self-selection into a mechanism that punishes the lowest contributors effects contributions both inside the group and with partners of the opposite background, and we show that it increases contributions by cooperative farmers interacting with non-cooperative farmers by more than 100\%.},

This study analyzes the problem of outside sales in a coffee cooperative in northern Peru, and finds that the labor practices of cooperative members exert significant influence on their level of outside sales. I find that coffee growers who use more intensively cooperative labor networks known as choba-choba, as well as family household labor, engage in fewer outside sales and channel more sales through the cooperative. These results imply a symbiotic relationship between agrarian marketing cooperatives and non-market labor practices, and suggest an important role for robust community structures in building sustainable livelihoods in agrarian regions of the developing world.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Most coffee in Ethiopia is produced by smallholder farmers who face a daily struggle to get sufficient income but also to feed their families. At the same time, many smallholder coffee producers are members of cooperatives. Yet, literature has paid little attention to the effect of cooperatives on combating food insecurity among cash crop producers including coffee farmers.
            
            
              Objective:
              The objective of the study was to investigate how coffee cooperative membership may affect food security among coffee farm households in Southwest Ethiopia.
            
            
              Methods:
              The study used cross-sectional household data on income, expenditure on food, staple food production (maize and teff), and utilization of improved inputs (fertilizer and improved seed) collected from 256 randomly selected farm households (132 cooperative members and 124 nonmembers) and applied an inverse probability weighting ({IPW}) estimation to assess the impact of cooperative membership on food security.
            
            
              Results:
              The result revealed that cooperative membership has a positive and significant effect on staple food production (maize and teff) and facilitated technological transformation via increased utilization of fertilizer and improved seeds. Nonetheless, the effect on food expenditure and income could not be confirmed.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Findings suggest a trade-off between coffee marketing and input supply functions of the cooperatives, impairing their true food security impact from the pooled income and production effect.},
